   <h1> Alkalinity </h1>
Alkalinity is a measure of the acid-neutralising capacity of water and is usually determined by titration against sulphuric acid to the endpoint of the acid–base reaction.</br></br>

From: Environmental Geochemistry, 2008</br></br>
Origin of Alkalinity</br></br>
Alkalinity in freshwater systems is derived from several sources: weathering of rocks and soil, exchange reactions in soils, biological uptake and reduction of strong acid anions, evaporation and precipitation of minerals, and atmospheric deposition of dust. Precipitation has little if any alkalinity, and in most systems, weathering is typically the dominant source of alkalinity for inland waters. In relatively unpolluted regions, precipitation is only slightly acidic because the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in equilibrium with pure water results in a weak carbonic acid solution with zero alkalinity but a pH of about 5.6. In industrialized areas, the sulfates and nitrates from emissions may result in precipitation with a pH of about 4.3 and an alkalinity of about negative 50 μeq l−1. In some arid regions, dry deposition of alkaline dusts may result in atmospheric alkalinity inputs to the inland waters.</br></br>
Weathering </br></br>
Most of the large variations in the alkalinity of inland waters can be attributed to the amount of weathering of bedrock material and soils derived from the bedrock. Rock types can be divided into three broad categories: slow weathering noncarbonate rock (igneous granite, gneiss) with resulting thin soils, low cation exchange capacity, and low pH; moderate weathering of rocks with low carbonate content, but deeper soils; and rapid weathering carbonate bedrock (e.g., sedimentary limestone), deep soils with high cation exchange and high soil pH. In areas where bedrock is deeply buried, soils play the major role in alkalinity of surface waters. The weathering of rock provides carbonates and to a lesser extent silicates as weak acid anions along with base cations such as calcium and magnesium from the rock. Even in areas dominated by silicate rocks, however, the more rapidly weathered carbonates, even if present in small amounts, tend to be the predominant source of alkalinity. Carbon dioxide in the air or water tends to increase weathering reactions because the carbonic acid formed lowers the pH. The additional weathering, particularly of carbonates, results in higher alkalinity export to surface waters.</br></br>
In rare cases, the weathering and oxidation of reduced iron and sulfur containing minerals such as pyrite found in some bedrocks and coal deposits may result in reductions in alkalinity as ferric hydroxides and sulfuric acid are produced. The oxidation of sulfides and accumulation of sulfuric acids in volcanic lakes may lead to extremely acid conditions with negative alkalinities.</br></br>
Cation Exchange</br></br>
Cation exchange can increase alkalinity whenever hydrogen ions in solution exchange on surfaces for base cations. The effect is generally reversible, and thus the process may not contribute to long-term increases in alkalinity once the cation exchange sites are depleted. In fact, cation exchange can act in reverse if base cations are added from sea spray or road salt to a soil solution, causing temporary acidification and loss of alkalinity. Nevertheless, soils with large cation exchange capacities can act as a large buffering reserve against relatively short-term acidification events.</br></br>

Assimilatory Uptake</br></br>
The uptake of inorganic carbon and other cations and anions during plant growth are generally balanced with little net effect on alkalinity with the general exception of nitrogen uptake. The uptake of nitrate during plant growth tends to raise alkalinity of the solution. Nitrate is assimilated by plants and reduced to amine groups R-NH2 with the net result being the removal of nitric acid. A general equation for the reaction is</br></br>

[6]106CO2+16H++16NO3−+H3PO4+122H2O→(CH2O)106(NH3)16H3PO4+138O2</br></br>
Forests, for example, may produce net gains in alkalinity in stream water by the uptake of nitrates found in acid precipitation. The opposite may occur in some systems, where ammonium [NH4+] is the dominant form of nitrogen uptake by plants or algae and results in loss of alkalinity as a hydroxide [OH−] is also taken up to balance the charges.</br></br>
Dissimilatory Redox Reactions</br></br>
A similar reaction may occur with dissimilatory uptake of acid anions. In this case anaerobic bacteria do not use the ions to build cellular material, but instead use the nitrate and sulfate ions as electron acceptors during anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. A simplified equation for sulfate reduction is</br></br>

[7]SO42−+2(CH2O)→H2S+2HCO3−</br></br>
This process strips the oxygen from the acid anions to produce CO2 and in effect removes the strong acids from solution. The reduced end products from the processes of denitrification and sulfate reduction are nitrogen gas and hydrogen sulfide, respectively. As long as the reduced end product is not reoxidized, the alkalinity gain is permanent. Nitrogen gas is stable and will not readily oxidize, and similarly, hydrogen sulfide gas may be lost to the atmosphere as a gas release or permanently stored in the sediments (e.g., as iron sulfide), thus preventing reoxidation.</br></br>

Similarly, the oxidized forms of metals such as iron and manganese can be used by bacteria as electron acceptors during anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. Again, this process produces alkalinity as long as the reduced metal end products are removed from the system and do not become reoxidized.</br></br>

In general, any chemical reduction of noncarbon compounds, such as minerals, metals, as well as reduction of sulfates and nitrates will increase the alkalinity of the system. Oxidations such as nitrification are a similar bacterial processes that operate in reverse. In the presence of oxygen, the bacterial oxidation of ammonium to nitrate provides energy for bacterial growth, which results in a loss in alkalinity.</br></br>

The amounts of alkali produced in any process can be estimated based on the coefficients of balanced chemical redox reactions. In summary, the in situ generation of alkali has the potential to neutralize acid precipitation inputs in some lakes that have long retention times. In quickly flushing lakes, however, the alkali generated within the lake is generally flushed out, and thus, the alkalinity of the lake is largely determined by processes within the lake's terrestrial watershed.</br></br>

Evaporation and Precipitation</br></br>
The amount of alkali produced by chemical precipitation reactions depends on the cations and anions involved. As noted earlier, precipitation of calcium carbonate as calcite removes two equivalents of alkalinity from solution because the base cation calcium is removed by a weak acid anion carbonate. However, the precipitation of gypsum, calcium sulfate CaSO4, has no effect because equal equivalents of base cation and strong acid anion are removed together.</br></br>

Just as dilute low alkalinity waters can mix with and reduce alkalinities of surface waters, such as occurs during large rainfall or snowmelt events, evaporation and transpiration can concentrate waters, resulting in seasonal and daily fluctuations in alkalinity. Evaporation has both a direct and indirect effect on alkalinity. Although evaporation per se does not alter the mass of dissolved ions, it does concentrate them, and thus if alkalinity is present (in either a positive or negative amount), it will be magnified by the concentration effect. The evaporation process also has indirect effects on the alkalinity of some systems, such as salt lakes. In lakes where evaporation greatly exceeds freshwater inputs, the solubility product of many minerals may be exceeded and precipitates will form. Typically the first minerals to precipitate are calcium and magnesium carbonates. In areas dominated by silicate bedrock weathering, other monovalent cations such as the alkali metals, sodium and potassium may be abundant enough to create alkaline soda lakes as the polyvalent cations quickly precipitate out of solution.</br></br>
